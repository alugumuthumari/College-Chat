# College-Chat
The College bot project is built using artificial algorithms that analyses user’s queries and understand user’s message. This System is a web application which provides answer to the query of the student. Students just have to query through the bot which is used for chating. Students can chat using any format there is no specific format the user has to follow. The System uses built in artificial intelligence to answer the query. 
The answers are appropriate what the user queries. The User can query any college related activities through the system. The user does not have to personally go to the college for enquiry. 
The System analyses the question and than answers to the user. The system answers to the query as if it is answered by the person. With the help of artificial intelligence, the system answers the query asked by the students. The system replies using an effective Graphical user interface which implies that as if a real person is talking to the user. T
he user just has to register himself to the system and has to login to the system. After login user can access to the various helping pages. Various helping pages has the bot through which the user can chat by asking queries related to college activities. The system replies to the user with the help of effective graphical user interface.
The user can query about the college related activities through online with the help of this web application. The user can query college related activities such as date and timing of annual day, sports day, and other cultural activities. This system helps the student to be updated about the college activities.
The questions we illustrated above were fairly straightforward. In the absence of an online chatbot, students would be able to get them answered by anyone who’s been on campus for a while – a senior student, the dorm’s resident advisor, or a faculty member. But a lot of the time, they need help with very specific issues and don’t know who to ask. And those are the situations where college enquiry chatbots become all the more important.

Universities that create a chatbot to respond to student queries, automatically create a more streamlined information exchange system. Students – both new and existing ones – don’t have to spend time figuring out who to direct their custom queries to. The College enquiry chatbot can take their questions and point them in the right direction.

Example 1:

Student: “I want to register for the summer internship program at [Institute] next year. How do I make sure I qualify?”

Chatbot: “Have you read the eligibility criteria for [Institute]’s summer internship program? You can read them on this link. Prof. J. Wilson ([Department]) handles applications for the program. You can get in touch with him for detailed information. Here are his contact details.”
